# Streamline-delivery
This is a repository for project management in the streamline-delivery project.

## How we work
- Build backlog with user stories
- Separate technical refinement
- Separate sprint planning meeting
- Sprint where we execute the plan
- Sprint retrospective

The user stories are created as milestones.
The implementation plan is broken down into work item issues which are associated with the milestone.
The sprint starts once the sprint planning is done and lasts for a week.


### Template for user story
```
Title: A short, descriptive title.

As a [type of user],
I want [an action or feature],

Acceptance Criteria

## Why we work like this
- Creating user stories with production increases the likelihood that we build the right thing.
- Creating an implementation plan increases the likelihood we build the thing right.
- Planning the sprints increases the likelihood that we build the things in the right order.
- Having retros increases the likelihood we do not repeat mistakes.

Doing the steps above separately decreases uncertainty about what needs to be done which means we get more things done.
